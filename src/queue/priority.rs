//! Local, pre-gossip ordering of a device's own outgoing payments.
//!
//! This is distinct from `stellarconduit_core::gossip::queue::MessagePriority`,
//! which governs mesh *forwarding* order for any envelope passing through a
//! peer. `TxPriority` governs the order in which *this device's own* queued
//! payments are signed and handed off to the mesh in the first place — e.g. an
//! emergency payment queued while offline should be dispatched ahead of a
//! routine one queued earlier.
//!
//! ## Emergency spending guard
//!
//! Because [`TxPriority::Emergency`] is specifically designed to jump the
//! queue and to be dispatched/propagated first, it is also the most
//! attractive tier for a thief to abuse: a lost or stolen unlocked device
//! (or a compromised wallet app) could queue an unbounded number of
//! Emergency payments before the owner notices, and those fraudulent
//! payments would settle ahead of the owner's own legitimate ones once the
//! device is back online.
//!
//! [`OutboundTxQueue`] therefore supports an optional, configurable
//! [`EmergencyGuardConfig`] that caps how many Emergency-tier entries may be
//! pushed within a rolling time window. Design decisions:
//!
//! * **Count-based, not value-based (for now).** A cumulative-XDR-value
//!   limit would be a stronger guard, but this crate does not yet parse
//!   amounts out of `tx_xdr` (see the top-level project's "Derive Source
//!   Account and Sequence Number from XDR" work). A count-based limit is
//!   documented here as the first version; value-based limiting can be
//!   layered on top once XDR parsing lands, without changing this API's
//!   shape (`EmergencyGuardConfig` can grow a `max_cumulative_value` field).
//! * **Per-window, not per-source-account (for now).** `OutboundTxQueue`
//!   only sees a [`TransactionEnvelope`] and a priority — the Stellar
//!   source account is tracked one layer up (e.g. `crate::storage::db`,
//!   `crate::queue::sequence`), not on the envelope itself. Per-account
//!   limiting is a reasonable follow-up once a source account is threaded
//!   through `push`.
//! * **Configurable at construction, not a global constant.** A personal
//!   wallet and a shared community relay terminal want very different
//!   thresholds, so the limit is a constructor argument
//!   ([`OutboundTxQueue::with_emergency_guard`]), not a hardcoded constant.
//! * **Persistence: in-memory counter, but seeded from durable state.**
//!   `OutboundTxQueue` itself is a transient, in-process structure — it is
//!   always rebuilt from durable storage after a restart (that's exactly
//!   what [`OutboundTxQueue::push_at`] is for). A purely in-memory guard
//!   counter would therefore be defeated by an attacker who force-restarts
//!   the app: the freshly-constructed queue's guard would start back at
//!   zero. To close that hole, `push_at` also folds Emergency entries into
//!   the guard's history (without re-running the limit check, since it is
//!   restoring decisions already made). The embedding wallet is expected to
//!   reload previously-queued Emergency envelopes from its durable store
//!   (e.g. `crate::storage::db::SyncEngineDb::list_queued_envelopes`, which
//!   already persists `priority` and `enqueued_at` for exactly this reason)
//!   and replay them through `push_at` before accepting new pushes. This
//!   avoids inventing a second, redundant persistence mechanism just for
//!   the guard: the existing queued-envelope table *is* the durable record,
//!   and the guard's in-memory state is a reconstructable cache over it —
//!   so a forced restart cannot reset the counter as long as the wallet
//!   performs this standard replay-on-startup step (see
//!   `test_limit_survives_restart` below for the shape of that replay).
