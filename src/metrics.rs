//! Protocol-level counters for the sync engine, mirroring the pattern used in
//! `stellarconduit-core::metrics`. Intended to be exposed by whichever binary
//! embeds this crate (mobile wallet, relay node).
//!
//! # Privacy-preserving export
//!
//! The in-process counters on [`SyncEngineMetrics`] stay exact — the engine
//! and the embedding binary need a precise view of their own queue. What must
//! not leave the device unchanged is a scrape of those counters: on a shared
//! community relay, or anywhere metrics are aggregated centrally, an exact
//! per-device `disputes_escalated` (or a sudden jump in it) can reveal that a
//! particular user or terminal is currently involved in a dispute. In the
//! disaster-relief / vulnerable-population settings this project is built
//! for, that disclosure is a real-world harm, not a theoretical one.
//!
//! [`DpExporter`] is the only supported off-device export path. It releases
//! **windowed event counts** (not lifetime totals) under the Laplace
//! mechanism, with a configurable privacy budget `ε`.
//!
//! ## Why windowed counts, not noisy lifetime totals
//!
//! A monotonically-increasing lifetime counter is the wrong unit to apply
//! differential privacy to, for three independent reasons:
//!
//! 1. **Repeated-query collapse.** A Prometheus scrape every 15s of the
//!    *same* underlying total, each time with fresh independent noise, is
//!    `T` queries against one dataset. Averaging T samples drives the noise
//!    to 0 as `1/√T` (and the Laplace mean is consistent), so the exact
//!    total is recovered in minutes. Noisy-lifetime export would therefore
//!    only be private for a one-shot dump, which is not how metrics are
//!    consumed.
//! 2. **Sensitivity grows with the user.** Neighboring datasets that differ
//!    by one device's entire history can differ by an unbounded amount on a
//!    lifetime total. Calibrating Laplace for that sensitivity makes the
//!    number useless; calibrating for Δ = 1 (one extra event) does *not*
//!    hide a spike of 50 disputes, which is exactly the signal the threat
//!    model cares about at the lifetime scale.
//! 3. **Operators want rates.** Network health monitoring asks "is this
//!    node failing *now*?", not "how many envelopes has it queued since
//!    first boot?". Prometheus `rate()` over a noisy counter is dominated
//!    by the noise jumps, not the true increment.
//!
//! Windowed counts fix all three. Each tumbling window is a *new* dataset:
//! a single event appears in exactly one window, so event-level `(ε, 0)`-DP
//! holds for that event regardless of how many later windows are released.
//! The sensitivity of one windowed counter, for the neighboring relation
//! "one additional event of this type in this window", is **Δ₁ = 1**.
//! Operators still see large rate changes (the health-monitoring job);
//! they cannot confidently confirm a single extra dispute.
//!
//! ## Mechanism: Laplace, not Gaussian
//!
//! The export is a 5-coordinate vector
//! `(queued, settled, failed, conflicts_detected, disputes_escalated)` of
//! windowed counts. One additional event changes **exactly one** coordinate
//! by 1, so the vector's L1 sensitivity is Δ₁ = 1. The Laplace mechanism
//! adds independent `Lap(b = Δ₁/ε)` noise to each coordinate and is
//! `(ε, 0)`-DP for that vector query (Dwork & Roth, *The Algorithmic
//! Foundations of Differential Privacy*, §3.3).
//!
//! Gaussian would give `(ε, δ)`-DP from L2 sensitivity (also 1 here). We
//! do not use it:
//!
//! - Five dimensions is not high enough for the L2/L1 gap to buy accuracy.
//! - Operators would have to pick `δ` as well as `ε`. `δ`-composition over
//!   years of scrapes is easy to get wrong and hard to explain.
//! - Pure `ε`-DP composes by addition with no extra parameter: T windows
//!   cost `Tε` under *user-level* composition (a user active in every
//!   window), and still just `ε` under *event-level* composition (the
//!   threat in the issue — "is this device in a dispute *right now*").
//!
//! Negative noisy counts are clamped to 0 before release. Clamping is a
//! function of the already-noised value, so post-processing immunity
//! preserves the DP guarantee. It introduces a small positive bias when
//! the true window count is near zero; that bias is visible in the
//! accuracy table below and is why the default `ε = 1` is a better
//! starting point than very small `ε` for sparse counters like
//! `disputes_escalated`.
//!
//! ## Repeated queries and the privacy budget
//!
//! Differential privacy is not free to re-apply. The policy this crate
//! **enforces**, not merely documents:
//!
//! - **One noisy snapshot per window.** The first scrape that needs a
//!   new window spends `ε` once, caches the result, and every subsequent
//!   scrape inside that window returns the *same* bytes. A 15-second
//!   Prometheus scrape against a 60-second window therefore costs `ε` per
//!   minute, not `ε` per scrape. Re-noising on every scrape is rejected
//!   because it would let an observer average out the noise.
//! - **Event-level DP does not erode across windows.** An event is in one
//!   window. Observing later windows does not spend more budget *against
//!   that event*. This is the threat model in the issue (current
//!   involvement in a dispute), and it is why the default configuration
//!   does not cap the number of window releases: network health monitoring
//!   is a continuous process, and stopping the endpoint after N scrapes
//!   would make the metrics useless.
//! - **User-level composition is opt-in.** If a deployment's threat model
//!   is "hide this device's *whole* activity over the lifetime of the
//!   process" rather than "hide a single event", T released windows
//!   compose to `Tε`. [`DpExportConfig::with_max_releases`] enforces a
//!   hard cap: after that many distinct window releases, further rolls
//!   return [`DpExportError::BudgetExhausted`] rather than falling back
//!   to the exact counters (a silent fallback would be a privacy hole).
//!   The last cached snapshot remains available until its window expires.
//!
//! The risk of the default (uncapped) policy, stated plainly: an adversary
//! who observes every window for a long-lived process learns the device's
//! approximate *activity level over time* to within Laplace noise per
//! window. They still cannot confirm any individual event at better than
//! `e^ε` odds. Deployments that consider the activity-level trace itself
//! sensitive should set `max_releases` (and/or a larger window / smaller
//! `ε`).
//!
//! ## Accuracy / privacy tradeoff
//!
//! For `Lap(b = 1/ε)` the mean absolute error is `b`, and the two-sided
//! percentiles of `|noise|` are `t = −b ln(1 − p)`:
//!
//! | `ε` | MAE (`b`) | 50th \|noise\| | 95th \|noise\| | 99th \|noise\| | What an operator can still see |
//! |-----|-----------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
//! | 0.1 | 10 | 6.9 | 30.0 | 46.1 | Outages and spikes of tens of events; a single dispute is well hidden. Sparse counters (`disputes_escalated`) will often read as a small positive even when truly 0 (clamp bias). |
//! | 0.5 | 2 | 1.4 | 6.0 | 9.2 | Changes of ~10+ events stand out; 1–3 extra events do not. |
//! | 1.0 | 1 | 0.69 | 3.0 | 4.6 | **Default.** Rate changes of ~10+ are clear; a single extra dispute cannot be confirmed. |
//! | 2.0 | 0.5 | 0.35 | 1.5 | 2.3 | Light privacy. Appropriate when scrapes are already aggregated across many devices before anyone looks at them. |
//!
//! These figures are exact properties of the Laplace distribution (they
//! do not depend on the true count, other than the near-zero clamp bias)
//! and are the numbers an operator should use when picking `ε`.
//! [`DpExportConfig::moderate`], [`DpExportConfig::strict`], and
//! [`DpExportConfig::relaxed`] pin the three common operating points.
//!
//! ## What this module will not do
//!
//! - It will not export exact lifetime totals, even alongside the noisy
//!   gauges. A second, exact channel would void the DP guarantee.
//! - It will not re-noise a cached window because a caller asked nicely.
//! - It will not, on budget exhaustion, return the raw atomics.
