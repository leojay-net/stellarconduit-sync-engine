///
/// - **`Permanent`** — the error is a caller-code bug or an irrecoverable
///   logical invariant violation. No amount of retrying will help; the caller
///   must fix the root cause (e.g. pass a valid sequence number, supply an
///   authorized signer).
///
/// - **`Transient`** — the error is likely caused by environmental conditions
///   (disk contention, lock conflicts, I/O races) that may resolve on their
///   own. A short retry with exponential back-off is appropriate.
///
/// - **`RequiresEscalation`** — neither retry nor give-up is the right move.
///   The error signals a situation that requires human intervention or an
///   off-chain → on-chain escalation path (see issue #002's dispute-resolver
///   contract). The embedding wallet should surface this to the user.

    ///
    /// # Classification rationale
    ///
    /// | Variant | Class | Why |
    /// |---------|-------|-----|
    /// | `NoSequenceReserved` | Permanent | The caller never called `seed()`/`reserve()` before attempting to build an envelope. This is a programming error; retrying the same call without fixing the caller will always fail. |
    /// | `SequenceOutOfOrder` | Permanent | The caller passed a sequence number that regresses or equals `last_reserved`. This is a logical invariant violation in caller code; the sequence must be corrected before any retry makes sense. |
    /// | `InvalidEnvelope` | Permanent | Envelope validation failed because the payload itself is malformed. The same invalid bytes will fail validation on every attempt. |
    /// | `XdrParse` | Permanent | The transaction XDR itself could not be parsed. The same bytes will fail to parse on every attempt; the caller must supply a well-formed transaction. |
    /// | `SourceAccountMismatch` | Permanent | The caller-claimed source account doesn't match the one encoded in the transaction XDR. This is a caller bug (wrong account supplied); retrying with the same mismatched inputs will always fail. |
    /// | `SequenceMismatch` | Permanent | The reserved sequence number doesn't match the one encoded in the transaction XDR. Retrying without correcting the sequence or the XDR will reproduce the same mismatch. |
    /// | `EnvelopeNotFound` | Permanent | A lookup by `message_id` returned nothing. The envelope was never enqueued, or has already been removed. Retrying the same lookup against the same DB will not materialise it. |
    /// | `InvalidStateTransition` | Permanent | A state-machine transition was attempted that is not in the legal transition graph. Retrying the same transition will never become legal; the caller has a logic bug. |
    /// | `BackpressureWindowFull` | Transient | The per-relay dispatch window is at capacity. Acks landing or timeout releases will free slots; retrying after a short back-off is exactly the intended behaviour. |
    /// | `DuplicateInFlight` | Permanent | The same message was acquired into the dispatch window twice without an intervening release. This is a caller bug; retrying identical inputs reproduces it. |
    /// | `InvalidDispatchWindow` | Permanent | The window configuration violates an invariant (zero capacity or zero timeout). Fix the configuration and construct again. |
    /// | `UnresolvedConflict` | RequiresEscalation | Two envelopes compete for the same account/sequence slot and could not be resolved off-chain. Neither retrying nor giving up is correct — the dispute must be escalated to the on-chain `dispute-resolver` contract (see issue #002). |
    /// | `VrfTiebreak` | Permanent | A supplied VRF tie-break proof is malformed, fails verification, or came from the wrong evaluator. The same bytes will fail the same way on every attempt; the resolution flow treats a tie with no valid tie-break as an ordinary `UnresolvedConflict` and escalates. |
    /// | `CompressedProofInvalid` | Permanent | A compressed relay-chain proof (issue #63) failed to fold or verify. The same artifact fails identically on every attempt; a well-formed proof must be produced, or the escalation must fall back to the raw per-hop proofs. |
    /// | `EmergencyQueueLimitExceeded` | RequiresEscalation | The spending guard has tripped. A simple retry without user re-confirmation would be a security bypass. The embedding wallet must surface this to the user (biometric re-auth or explicit override) before queuing is retried. |
    /// | `UnknownMultisigSigner` | Permanent | The presented signing key is not in the account's authorised signer set. No retry will change the signer registry without an explicit key-management operation. |
    /// | `MultisigThresholdNotMet` | Permanent | The accumulated signer weight is below the required threshold. In this context the error means promotion was attempted prematurely; more signatures are needed, which is a caller flow issue, not a transient I/O problem. |
    /// | `ConnectionError` | Transient | `tokio_rusqlite` errors typically arise from thread-pool contention, busy-timeout, or a momentary lock on the WAL file. These conditions usually resolve within milliseconds and are appropriate to retry with back-off. |
    /// | `SqliteError` | Transient | Raw `rusqlite` errors (e.g. `SQLITE_BUSY`, `SQLITE_LOCKED`) are similarly caused by disk/locking contention and are generally safe to retry. Callers that need to distinguish truly fatal SQLite errors (e.g. corruption) may inspect the inner `rusqlite::Error` further, but the default classification is Transient. |
    /// | `SerializationError` | Permanent | A value could not be encoded to MessagePack. This reflects a type-system mismatch or an unencodable value; retrying the same data will produce the same error. |
    /// | `DeserializationError` | Permanent | Stored bytes could not be decoded. The bytes are corrupted or were written by an incompatible schema version. Retrying the same read will not repair the data. |
    /// | `CompressionError` | Permanent | An at-rest compression frame (issue #56 / #93) could not be built or decoded: bad magic, truncated header, invalid DEFLATE stream, or an oversized decompression. The same stored bytes fail identically on every attempt. |
    /// | `ImportTargetNotEmpty` | Permanent | `import_snapshot`'s documented policy refuses a non-empty target. Retrying the identical call against the same database will always hit the same refusal; the caller must choose a fresh database. |
    /// | `IncompatibleSnapshotSchemaVersion` | Permanent | The snapshot was produced by a different schema version than this build expects. Retrying the same import will reproduce the same mismatch; a migration path is needed instead. |
