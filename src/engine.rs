//! `SyncEngine` — the restart-safe driver that wires together the queue,
//! sequence reservation, offline signing, durable storage, and settlement
//! tracking components into a single API a wallet or relay node can embed.
//!
//! ## Crash-consistency contract
//!
//! StellarConduit devices stay offline for long stretches and can be killed at
//! any instant — battery death, OS eviction, reboot. The engine's central
//! guarantee is that [`SyncEngine::open`] on the next launch reconstructs
//! exactly the state a fully-completed previous call would have produced, and
//! that a crash mid-call can never silently lose a queued payment, reuse a
//! sequence number, or re-dispatch an envelope that was already handed to the
//! mesh.
//!
//! To deliver that, durable SQLite storage is the single source of truth. All
//! in-memory state — the [`OutboundTxQueue`], the [`SequenceReservationManager`],
//! and the [`SettlementTracker`] — is *rehydrated* from it on every `open`, so
//! ephemeral memory can be discarded freely.
//!
//! Per-method write ordering:
//!
//! - **`queue_payment`**: the sequence reservation, the signed envelope, and
//!   its initial `Queued` settlement status are written to SQLite in **one
//!   atomic transaction** (`SyncEngineDb::enqueue_transaction`), and only then
//!   is the in-memory queue/tracker touched. A crash during the call therefore
//!   leaves the database either fully written (the call completed) or
//!   completely untouched (as if it never ran) — never half-written. This
//!   matters because a Stellar sequence number cannot be skipped on-chain:
//!   persisting the reservation without the envelope (or the envelope without
//!   the reservation) would either burn an unrecoverable gap or invite a reuse,
//!   and both are real double-spend hazards against the user's own account.
//!
//! - **`next_to_dispatch`**: the envelope's settlement status is advanced to
//!   `Propagating` and **persisted before** the envelope leaves the in-memory
//!   queue. If the device dies between dispatch and settlement, the next
//!   `open` sees `Propagating` (not `Queued`) and so never re-queues the
//!   envelope — no duplicate handoff to the mesh.
//!
//! - **`mark_settlement`**: the transition is validated (via
//!   [`SettlementStatus::can_transition_to`]) first; the new status is
//!   persisted, and only then is the in-memory tracker advanced, so the two
//!   never disagree.
