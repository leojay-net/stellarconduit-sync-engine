//! Restart-safety tests for `SyncEngine`.
//!
//! These deliberately use a real **temp-file-backed** SQLite database rather
//! than `:memory:`, because an in-memory database does not survive being
//! reopened and therefore cannot exercise *any* restart behavior — which is
//! the whole point of the crash-consistency contract. Each simulated "crash"
//! is modelled by dropping the `SyncEngine` (closing both of its SQLite
//! connections) and then calling `SyncEngine::open` again on the same path.
